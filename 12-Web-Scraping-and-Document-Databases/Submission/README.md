# Web Scraping- Mission to Mars


The goal for this project was to build a webpage that has updated information based off 3 different websites.
 Using Jupyter notebook, I was able to scrape the most recent Nasa news, url for the featured image, 4 Mars hemisphere images, 
 and a few Mars facts. I used BeatifulSoup, Pandas, & Splinter to scrape infromation needed. I then used Flask app to route the loading
  of the webpage, scraping content, connection and insertion of data to and from mongoDB. Finally, I built the webpage using HTML 
  and loaded the data using Jinja. I used bootstrap to style the webpage. 


### Websites used

 - [Red Planet Science](https://redplanetscience.com/)
 - [Space Images](https://spaceimages-mars.com/)
 - [Mars Hemispheres](https://marshemispheres.com/)
